        <h2>Automatic Savings Calculations (cont.)</h2>
        <p>
          Led the development of an energy analytics platform that enables dynamic energy savings calculations and advanced visualization. Deployed a fully responsive web application and complex data model to complete automation tasks and improve data consistency.
          Reduced building audit time by 10-12%. The use of Highcharts and custom Javascript/JQuery features allowed visual data manipulation and a simplified workflow for engineers. Pioneered company usage of single-purpose Python/Flask web applications.
          The platform was developed in a highly modular way enabling the core calculation module to be reused in other products. Deployed on AWS via Atlassian Bamboo Server for continuous integration and testing. Jira and Confluence were used to track
          tickets and host documentation.

        <h2>Gradr: Academic Grade Calculator</h2>
        <p>
          Worked with <a target="_blank" id="red-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinlittman">Justin Littman</a> to develop and deploy a fully-responsive and dynamic grade calculator using Python Flask and MongoDB. The web application allowed
          users to track grades in a variety of categories including homework, exams, and quizzes. It additionally supported Google and Facebook OAuth for user sign-up and authentication. As a demo and for testing purposes the application and database
          were hosted on DigitalOcean. <a target="_blank" id="red-link" href="../resources/gradr-pitch-deck.pdf">View our pitch deck </a>which was presented to a group of Northeastern students and faculty.

        <p>
          I developed a Java application that allowed for the playback, editing, and visualization of songs via the MIDI and Swing libraries.

        <h2>Bottlenose Submission Helper</h2>
        <p>
          Northeastern developed a custom homework grading server called Bottlenose which required students to manually zip the correct project directory, excluding hidden files, in order for the server to properly process submissions. I wrote a shell script that
          automatically created the proper zip before opening a web browser pointed to the correct submission page. This tool was used by a large majority of the students enrolled in the course. It's accompanied by a <a id="red-link" target="_blank"

          download page </a>which is statically hosted on Surge.sh.
